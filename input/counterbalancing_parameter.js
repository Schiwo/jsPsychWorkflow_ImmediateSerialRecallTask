/**
 * Creates and returns the configuration object that controls how trials are counterbalanced.
 *
 * This function defines how experimental factors are combined, how often each factor
 * level appears, and how factor levels are allowed to transition from one trial to the next.
 * It also specifies whether additional trials should be prepended or appended to the balanced
 * sequence and how those extra trials should follow the same (or different) transition rules.
 *
 * The returned object is used by the trial sequence generator to build balanced and
 * rule-consistent trial lists for both training and main experimental blocks.
 *
 * Keeping all counterbalancing settings here makes it easy to adjust the experimental design
 * (e.g., changing the number of factors, adding transition constraints, or enabling debug
 * output) without modifying the sequence-generation logic itself.
 *
 * @returns {Object} An object containing all counterbalancing parameters and transition rules.

/*
#### How to use? ####

factors: set factors and factor levels.
    Input must be an array with n integers with n = the number of fators. 
    Each entry represents a factor, and the integer at each position represents this factor's number of levels.
    E. g., [2,3] means the factorial design will be balanced along two factors. factor 1 has 2 levels (either 0 or 1), factor 2 has 3 levels (0, 1, or 2).
    createTrialSequences()  creates an array with equally balacnced factor permutations based on transition rules, resulting in an array with the structure:
    [[trial1],[trial2]...] whereby each trial contains an array with N factors [[factor1,factor2, ... ,factorN], [factor1,factor2, ... ,factorN]]

factorProportions: Set the proportion of how often factor levels occur.
    Input must be an array with n elements, with n = the number of factors.
    Each element must be either null, if each factor level should occur equally oftern, or an array of x integers, with x = the number of factor levels.
    Each integer reflects the proportion of occurences for this factor level.
    e.g. [[1,5], null]: factor level 0 of factor1 will be displayed 5 times as often as factor level 1 of factor1; the factor levels of factor2 will occur equally often.
    multiple factor proportions are allowed (e.g. [[1,5], [2,3], [7,3], [5,4]]).
    factor proportions can restrict transition rules.

transitionRules: Set the rules for the trial to trial transitions of each factor.
    Input must be an array with n elements, with n = the number of factors.
    Each element must be either null, if there are no specific transition rules for this factor, a function for custom rules, or an array containing the rules parameters for this 
    factor:
    The implemented options for transition rules are:
    null: the factor level will be pseudo randomly determined.
    function: a custom rule function (see CUSTOM TRANSITION RULES section above).
    ["identical", x, y]: The factor level must be identical as the to factor level of factor y, but x trial before the current trial.
    ["different", x, y]: The factor level cannot be different than the factor level of factor y, but x trial before the current trial.
    ["next", x]: The factor level of the same factor in the last trial will be increased by x in a circular way (e.g. factor level 0 becomes factor level 1; after the last factor 
    level x, it restarts with factor level 0).

    #### CUSTOM TRANSITION RULES ####
    In addition to the built-in transition rules, you can define custom rule functions.
    A custom rule function receives three parameters:
    - numLevels: Number of levels for this factor
    - currentIndex: Current trial index (0-indexed)
    - previousTrials: Array of all previously selected trial combinations

    The function should return either:
    - An array of valid level indices (e.g., [0, 1, 2] means levels 0, 1, or 2 are valid)
    - A single level index (e.g., 0 means only level 0 is valid)

    For detailed examples (ABBAABBAA pattern, alternating pattern, avoid repetition, etc.),
    see COUNTERBALANCING_EXPLANATION.txt


sets: amount of trials with identical factors per block (e.g. if sets = 3, each factor level combination will occur 3 times per block). 

preprendTrials: number of additional trials you want to prepend before the trials balanced according to the previously declared parameter (e.g. because you included transition rules and
    you want to include a matching trial). Please note that these additional trials do not come from the balanced pool as the other trials.

prependRules: Set the rules for the prepended trials. The rules are declared as described under transitionRules. PLEASE NOTE that to apply the rules for the prepended trials 
    the already created trial list is reversed (the first trial becomes the last trial), then the declared number of trials are appended to the list, and then the list is reversed again.
    This might affect how you have to specify the prependRules (in the present example, we want to prepend a trial that fullfills the "previous congruency" factor of the first trial specified 
    under transition rules; For this purpose we specifiy that current "congruency factor" of the prepended trial must be identical to the "previous congruency" factor of the last trial 
    (which due to the reverse-mechanism is the first trial of the already created list).

appendTrials: number of additional trials you want to append after the trials balanced according to the previously declared parameter. 
    Please note that these additional trials do not come from the balanced pool as the other trials.

appendRules: Set the rules for the appended trials. The rules are declared as described under transitionRules.

debugMode: Set to true to enable debug mode, which provides additional information in the console about the counterbalancing process.
