/**
 * Builds and returns the full jsPsych timeline for the experiment.
 *
 * The timeline defines the complete sequence of events a participant will experience (eg welcome screens, instructions,  experimental trials,
 * break screens etc) as well as functional elements (eg data-saving).
 *
 * This function gathers all required configuration and helper objects (e.g., experiment
 * settings, counterbalancing rules, functional trials, and instructions), generates
 * condition sequences for training and main blocks, and then assembles everything
 * into a single ordered array that jsPsych can run.
 *
 * @returns {Array} An ordered list (the "timeline") of jsPsych elements that make up the experiment flow.
